ros-indigo-schunk-powercube-chain (0.5.1-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * removed a lot of code related to packages not available in hydro anymore
  * add definitions to get rid of some compiler warnings
  * fixed linking error of SDH and CAN libraries
  * Initial catkinization. Still a linking error in sdh lib.
  * Offsets added in PowercubeChain
  * merge conficts solved
  * Recover function changed (syncmotion deleted)
  * untested version that handels offsets inside ROS.
  * IMPORTANT changes in init! No offset used anymore. No limits are set to the modules to avoid errors in the PRL-Modules
  * Bug in reset during init fixed
  * fix compile issue
  * fix compile issue on natty
  * remove c++0x
  * Recover function improved
  * remove std=c++0x
  * spare includes deleted
  * added little comments
  * Restsequence in init() changed to avoid problems during 'init all' if there are more chains on one bus.
  * changed error on com to debug message
  * change to debug message
  * -check of return values added in init() -aborting homing because of out of limits limited to only for PW-modules.
  * Merge remote branch 'origin-ipa320/master' into automerge
  * added effort to joint states message
  * communication check for offset writing added
  * communication check for setOffsets added.
  * Too much output removed. Velocity smoothing reactivated.
  * Init procedure improved in the case that 2 chains access the same bus.
  * Check of joint position for limits during homing added to avoid fast movement if module is unreferenced.
  * merge errors removed
  * initalisation of m_position variable with true position from module added
  * first draft of diagnostics class
  * first draft of diagnostics class
  * slightly changes. work in progress.
  * Merge remote branch 'origin-ipa320/master' into automerge
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:ipa-tif/schunk_modular_robotics
  * little format changes
  * movestep debuggin and adding force_movevel
  * remove info output
  * Bugfix in moveVel
  * ResetAll replaced by resetModule, Diagnositcs output improved, changes in moveVel
  * work in progress on limit handling
  * Getting out of soft limits improved
  * Output for diagnostics improved
  * output for diagnostics improved
  * selection of module type by encoder added, reading of module type parameter in .yaml removed
  * firmware version dependend swichting between moveVelExt and moveStepExt for PRL-Modules
  * automatic ModulType check removed, because Encoder Types are not provided. Info output on homing improved.
  * improvments on ModuleType investigation
  * merge
  * Moduletype is read from module, comments added
  * Moduletype is read from module
  * Fixed stop of all motor on the bus in error case of one. Now only the motors in a kinematic chain are stopped.
  * PW-Module homing tested, Rrecovering of only stall modules added, Stop command in global error case added, check for homing flag bevor homing added
  * display version number on init added
  * Switching of moveVel and moveStep depending on ModuleTypeadded.
  * support for homing PRL and PW modules added
  * ModuleType added for support of PW and PRL modules
  * changed frequency again to avoid CAN bus crashes
  * removed debug messages, changed frequency settings
  * update stack description
  * modified threading in powercube chain, added velocity calculation and fixed moveStep issues
  * removed unused files
  * add libm5api as source code package
  * fill velocities in controller/state message
  * fixed position value bug for stable movements
  * remove newlines in diagnosticmsgs
  * fixed error state bug
  * added errorstring to diagnostic messages, has to be tested on real hardware
  * added diagnotic topic for initialization states
  * modifications for powercubechain to work with tray and torso
